# Bug Resolution Report - 2025-10-02

## 🐛 Bug Information
**Repository:** SiddhlodaAyyar/Simple-To-Do-List-App
**Issue:** Only completed tasks ('Task A') remain in the list. All incomplete tasks are incorrectly removed.
**Severity:** high
**Category:** UI/Frontend

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
- A logical error in the `Array.prototype.filter()` method within the `clearCompleted` event handler. The condition incorrectly keeps completed tasks instead of removing them.
- The bug is a regression caused by commit `35dbb2a` (via PR #4), which explicitly reverted a previous, correct fix (from PR #3).
- A potential development process issue, as the same fix has been merged and reverted twice, indicating conflicting changes or a misunderstanding of the feature's requirements.

## 🛠️ Recommended Fixes
- In `src/components/TodoApp.tsx`, locate the `clearCompleted` event handler and change the state update logic from `tasks.filter(task => task.completed)` to `tasks.filter(task => !task.completed)`. This re-applies the fix from the reverted PR #3.
- Add a unit or integration test that specifically covers the 'Clear completed' functionality. The test should assert that after clicking the button, only tasks where `completed` is `false` remain in the state.
- Investigate the reason for the repeated reverts (PR #2 and PR #4). Communicate with the author ('Yash G') to prevent this regression from being reintroduced in the future.

## 📝 Code Analysis Results
- src/components/TodoApp.tsx: The event handler for the 'Clear completed' button likely contains the line `setTasks(tasks.filter(task => task.completed))`. This logic is inverted.
- Git History: The repository history shows a pattern of fixing and reverting this specific line of code, confirming it as the exact location of the bug.

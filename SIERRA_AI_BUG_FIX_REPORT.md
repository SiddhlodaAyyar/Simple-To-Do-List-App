# Bug Resolution Report - 2025-10-02

## 🐛 Bug Information
**Repository:** SiddhlodaAyyar/Simple-To-Do-List-App
**Issue:** The tasks that are 'incomplete' are removed from the list, leaving only the 'complete' tasks. This is the inverse of the expected behavior.
**Severity:** high
**Category:** UI/Frontend

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
- A persistent logical error in the `Array.prototype.filter()` method within the `clearCompleted` event handler, where the condition incorrectly keeps completed tasks (`task.completed`) instead of incomplete ones (`!task.completed`).
- A critical development process failure, evidenced by a 'revert war' where the correct fix has been merged and subsequently reverted three times in a row (PRs #3/#4, #5/#6).
- Lack of automated testing for this core feature, which allows this obvious regression to be repeatedly reintroduced into the main branch without being caught.

## 🛠️ Recommended Fixes
- Immediately re-apply the correct logic in `src/components/TodoApp.tsx`. Change the filter condition in the `clearCompleted` handler to `tasks.filter(task => !task.completed)`. This has been done in PR #5 and needs to be the final state.
- Implement a unit or integration test that verifies the 'Clear completed' functionality. This test must fail when the logic is incorrect and pass when it is correct, preventing future regressions from being merged.
- Conduct an immediate team review to understand the root cause of the repeated reverts. Lock the affected file or branch if necessary until all developers are aligned on the correct behavior to prevent this cycle from continuing.

## 📝 Code Analysis Results
- src/components/TodoApp.tsx: The event handler for the 'Clear completed' button contains the faulty logic. The state update is likely using `setTasks(tasks.filter(task => task.completed))`, which incorrectly filters the list.

## 🔗 Related Issues Found
- #6: Revert "Fix: Bug: When I click the clear completed button..." - This is the most recent PR that reintroduced the bug.
- #5: Fix: Bug: When I click the clear completed button... - This is the most recent correct fix that was subsequently reverted.
- #3 & #4: An earlier cycle of the same fix and revert, indicating a recurring problem.

# Bug Resolution Report - 2025-09-22

## 🐛 Bug Information
**Repository:** SiddhlodaAyyar/Simple-To-Do-List-App
**Issue:** When the 'Clear completed' button is clicked, the incomplete tasks are removed from the list, and only the completed tasks remain. This is the inverse of the expected functionality.
**Severity:** high
**Category:** UI/Frontend

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
- The primary cause is an inverted boolean condition within the array filter method used by the `clearCompletedButtonEventHandler`.
- The logic is currently filtering to *keep* tasks where `task.completed` is true, instead of keeping tasks where `task.completed` is false.
- The application state is being updated with this incorrectly filtered list, leading to the UI displaying the opposite of the expected outcome.

## 🛠️ Recommended Fixes
- Locate the event handler responsible for clearing completed tasks (e.g., `handleClearCompleted`, `clearCompletedTasks`).
- Modify the array filter condition to correctly select only incomplete tasks. Change `tasks.filter(task => task.completed)` to `tasks.filter(task => !task.completed)`.
- Ensure the component's state is updated with the result of this corrected filter operation.
- Consider adding a unit test for this specific functionality to prevent future regressions.

## 📝 Code Analysis Results
- The issue is located in the event handler function for the 'Clear completed' button's click event.
- Specifically, the `.filter()` call on the tasks array is using a condition like `task.completed` when it should be `!task.completed` or `task.completed === false`.

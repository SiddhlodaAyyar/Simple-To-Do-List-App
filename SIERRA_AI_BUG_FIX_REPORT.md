# Bug Resolution Report - 2025-09-22

## 🐛 Bug Information
**Repository:** SiddhlodaAyyar/Simple-To-Do-List-App
**Issue:** When the 'Clear completed' button is clicked, all incomplete tasks are removed from the list, and only the completed tasks remain.
**Severity:** high
**Category:** UI/Frontend

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
- The primary cause is an inverted boolean condition within the array's `.filter()` method, located in the event handler for the 'Clear completed' button. The current logic keeps completed tasks instead of incomplete ones.
- A correct fix for this issue was previously merged in Pull Request #1 (commit `e833d7a`) but was subsequently reverted by Pull Request #2 (commit `a5c977b`).
- The bug was therefore intentionally or unintentionally reintroduced into the main branch after being resolved.

## 🛠️ Recommended Fixes
- Re-apply the change from the reverted Pull Request #1. Locate the event handler for the 'Clear completed' button and change the filter condition from `tasks.filter(task => task.completed)` to `tasks.filter(task => !task.completed)`.
- Alternatively, use git to revert the commit that undid the fix. Run `git revert a5c977b98ac782dae31cca27101c7506fcefce0b` to create a new commit that restores the correct code.
- Crucially, investigate why the original fix (PR #1) was reverted. This suggests a potential communication breakdown or an undocumented side effect of the fix that must be understood before re-applying the change.

## 📝 Code Analysis Results
- The commit history is the most critical piece of evidence. The revert of a specific bug fix (commit `5c7165b`) strongly indicates the exact location and nature of the error.
- The code in question resides within the `clearCompletedButtonEventHandler` (or a similarly named function) and involves the state update logic, specifically the line that calls `tasks.filter(...)` before setting the new state.

## 🔗 Related Issues Found
- #1: A pull request that correctly fixed the inverted filter logic was merged.
- #2: This pull request reverted the fix from PR #1, causing the bug to reappear in the codebase.
